# MinesweeperProject
Project in my second semester in the module "web-client-technologies". 

We had to create a minesweeper game but only using JavaScript, HTML and CSS.

It was my first big project, so there can be some bugs - sorry for that, it is not perfect :)
But I'm still a little bit proud of the outcoming.
